# IJAA (Alumni Association) - Microservices Project Context

## Project Overview
IJAA (International Jute Alumni Association) is a comprehensive microservices-based alumni management system built with Spring Boot. The system facilitates alumni networking, event management, file handling, and advanced event features through a distributed architecture.

**Recent Update (August 2025)**: Removed Event Analytics, Event Templates, Calendar Integration, Event Reminders, and Recurring Events features to streamline the system and focus on core functionality. Fixed critical bugs in Event APIs including search functionality, comment user authentication, and nested comment responses.

- ✅ `GET /{eventId}/banner/file/{fileName}` - Serve event banner file (public)

### Security and Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: Frontend → Gateway → User Service
2. **Login**: Frontend → Gateway → User Service (returns JWT)
3. **Authenticated Requests**: Frontend (with JWT) → Gateway → Services
4. **User Context**: Gateway extracts user info from JWT and forwards to services
5. **Feature Flag Checks**: Frontend → Gateway (public) → User Service (public)

### Gateway Routing Configuration
The gateway service provides intelligent routing with the following patterns:

#### **Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required):**
- `GET /ijaa/api/v1/admin/feature-flags/{name}/enabled` - Feature flag status check
- `GET /ijaa/api/v1/users/*/profile-photo/file/**` - Profile photo serving
- `GET /ijaa/api/v1/users/*/cover-photo/file/**` - Cover photo serving

#### **Protected Endpoints (Authentication Required):**
- All other admin endpoints (`/ijaa/api/v1/admin/**`)
- All user endpoints (`/ijaa/api/v1/user/**`)
- All event endpoints (`/ijaa/api/v1/user/events/**`)
- All file management endpoints (`/ijaa/api/v1/users/**`)

#### **✅ FIXED: Gateway Routing Order (August 2025)**
The gateway now properly routes requests in the correct order:
1. **Feature flag status checks** (public)
2. **Admin routes** (protected)
3. **User events routes** (protected) - **MUST come before general user routes**

5. **General user routes** (protected)
6. **Event service routes** (protected)
7. **File service routes** (protected)

This ensures that `/ijaa/api/v1/user/events/advanced-search/**` routes to the event service instead of the user service.

## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure
Each service follows standard Spring Boot structure:
```
src/
├── main/
│   ├── java/com/ijaa/{service}/
│   │   ├── controller/     # REST controllers
│   │   ├── service/        # Business logic
│   │   ├── repository/     # Data access
│   │   ├── domain/         # DTOs and entities
│   │   ├── config/         # Configuration
│   │   └── common/         # Utilities and common code
│   └── resources/
│       ├── application.yml # Service configuration
│       └── data.sql       # Initial data (if any)
└── test/                  # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer logic testing
- **Integration Tests**: Full API endpoint testing  
- **Authorization Tests**: Role-based access control validation
