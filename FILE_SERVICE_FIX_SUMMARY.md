# File Service Media Upload Fix Summary

## Issue
The event post API was getting an error when trying to upload media files. The error was:
```
"No static resource ijaa/api/v1/files/posts/29/media"
```

This indicated that Spring Boot was trying to handle the API request as a static resource instead of routing it to the controller.

## Root Cause
Spring Boot's automatic static resource handling was interfering with the API endpoints. The `add-mappings: false` configuration was not sufficient to prevent this issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated WebConfig.java
- **File**: `file-service/src/main/java/com/ijaa/file/config/WebConfig.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Disabled automatic static resource handling with `add-mappings: false`
  - Added explicit resource handlers only for `/uploads/**` and `/files/**` paths
  - Added request interceptor for debugging
  - Added custom resource resolver that rejects API paths

### 2. Updated application.yml
- **File**: `file-service/src/main/resources/application.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `spring.web.resources.add-mappings: false` to disable automatic static resource handling

### 3. Added Debugging
- **File**: `file-service/src/main/java/com/ijaa/file/controller/EventPostMediaController.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Added test endpoint `/test` for verification
  - Added detailed logging to upload and get methods

### 4. Created Test Script
- **File**: `test-file-service.sh`
- **Purpose**: Test the file service endpoints directly

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the File Service
```bash
cd file-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Test the Endpoints
```bash
# Test the test endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8083/api/v1/files/posts/test"

# Test get all post media
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8083/api/v1/files/posts/29/media"

# Test upload (will fail without proper auth, but should not give static resource error)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8083/api/v1/files/posts/29/media" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@test_image.png" \
  -F "mediaType=IMAGE" \
  -H "X-Username: testuser"
```

### 3. Run the Test Script
```bash
./test-file-service.sh
```

## Expected Results

1. **Test endpoint**: Should return "EventPostMediaController is working"
2. **Get media endpoint**: Should return 404 (no media files) or list of media files
3. **Upload endpoint**: Should return 401/403 (unauthorized) but NOT the static resource error

## Key Configuration Changes

### WebConfig.java
```java
@Configuration
@Slf4j
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    
    @Override
    public void addResourceHandlers(@NonNull ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
        // Only handle specific static resource paths, not API paths
        registry.addResourceHandler("/uploads/**")
                .addResourceLocations("file:" + normalizedPath)
                .setCachePeriod(3600)
                .resourceChain(true)
                .addResolver(new PathResourceResolver());

        // Handle static files for serving uploaded files (not API endpoints)
        registry.addResourceHandler("/files/**")
                .addResourceLocations("file:" + normalizedPath)
                .setCachePeriod(3600)
                .resourceChain(true)
                .addResolver(new PathResourceResolver());
    }
}
```

### application.yml
```yaml
spring:
  web:
    resources:
      add-mappings: false  # Disable automatic static resource handling
```

## Verification

The fix should resolve the "No static resource" error and allow the file service to properly handle API requests for post media upload and retrieval.

## Next Steps

1. Test the file service independently
2. Test through the gateway service
3. Test the complete flow from event service to file service
4. Verify that media files are properly uploaded and served
